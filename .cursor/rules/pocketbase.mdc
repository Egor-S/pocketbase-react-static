Backend uses Pocketbase Go Framework. It is evolving rapidly, worth checking the latest documentation at https://pocketbase.io/docs/.

You can start pocketbase server with:

```bash
cd pocketbase
go run . serve
```

Once database schema is changed and migrations are auto-generated, you should regenerate types for React:

```bash
cd react
npm run typegen
```
